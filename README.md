# FinCap

## Description

FinCap is a budgeting application that allows users to authenticate in and create and maintain bank accounts
In terms of the tech stack, I utilized Sass for styling, React for components for the fronend, Express middleware, Node.js for the backend and MongoDB in conjunction with Mongoose for the database.

## Usage

Users are able to create accounts --> email and password is used for login.

Users are able to add transactions in the form of income or expenses. 

At this time (10-12-21), users are not able to add seperate accounts.** 

**See Roadmap below for more information on the future of the project.

## Roadmap

For the time being, this project is very bare bones. I would like to add the ability to use multiple account along with using validation and third party APIs to pull actual account data for user accounts.
